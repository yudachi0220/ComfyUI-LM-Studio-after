# ComfyUI LM Studio Node

A powerful ComfyUI custom node that seamlessly integrates LM Studio's local language models into your ComfyUI workflows. This node supports both text-only and multimodal (text + image) inputs, making it perfect for complex AI-driven creative workflows.

## Features

- **Unified Interface**: Single node for both text-only and text+image inputs
- **Dual Mode Support**: Works with both LM Studio SDK (recommended) and REST API
- **Vision Model Support**: Process images alongside text prompts with compatible models
- **Real-time Statistics**: Monitor tokens per second, input/output token counts
- **Thinking Tokens**: Optional support for models that use thinking tokens
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, seed, and server settings
- **Random Seed Support**: Control reproducibility with seed parameter (0 = random)
- **Model Unloading**: Dedicated node to free VRAM by unloading models from memory
- **Debug Mode**: Built-in debugging for troubleshooting

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **ComfyUI**: Make sure you have ComfyUI installed and running
2. **LM Studio**: Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) (free)
3. **Python**: Python 3.8 or higher
4. **Show Text Node**: Install [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) for the Show Text node used in the example workflow (any other text display node will also work)

### Installation Steps

1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabe-init/ComfyUI-LM-Studio
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI-LM-Studio
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Restart ComfyUI to load the new node

### LM Studio Setup

1. Open LM Studio and download a model (e.g., Mistral 7B Instruct)
2. Start the local server in LM Studio (default port: 1234)
3. Note the model ID from LM Studio for use in the node

## Usage

### Basic Text Generation

1. Add the "LM Studio Chat Interface" node to your workflow
2. Configure the following inputs:
   - **System Prompt**: Set the assistant's behavior
   - **User Message**: Your input prompt
   - **Model ID**: The exact model ID from LM Studio
   - **Server Address**: Usually `http://127.0.0.1:1234`
   - **Temperature**: Control randomness (0.0-1.0)
   - **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length

### Vision Model Usage

For models that support vision (like LLaVA):

1. Connect an image output to the node's image input
2. The node will automatically process both text and image
3. Make sure you're using the SDK mode for image support

### Configuration Options

- **Use SDK**: Enable for better performance and image support (requires `lmstudio` package)
- **Include Thinking Tokens**: For models that support chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Seed**: Set a specific seed for reproducible outputs (0 lets LM Studio use random seed)
- **Debug Mode**: Enable to see detailed processing information

### Model Unload Node

Use the "LM Studio Unload Model" node to free VRAM when you're done with inference:

1. Add the "LM Studio Unload Model" node to your workflow
2. Configure:
   - **Server Address**: Same as your chat node (default: `http://127.0.0.1:1234`)
   - **Model ID**: Leave empty to unload the current model, or specify a model ID
   - **Use SDK**: Enable if SDK is installed (recommended)

The node outputs a status string confirming the unload result.

## Example Workflow

An example workflow is included in `example_workflow/Example_Workflow.json`. This demonstrates:
- Basic text generation setup
- Parameter configuration
- Integration with other ComfyUI nodes

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure LM Studio server is running
- Check the server address matches LM Studio's settings
- Verify firewall isn't blocking local connections

### Performance Tips
- Use SDK mode when possible for better performance
- Adjust max tokens based on your needs
- For vision models, use reasonable image sizes

### Common Errors
- "Model not found": Verify the model ID matches exactly what's shown in LM Studio
- "Connection refused": Make sure LM Studio server is started
- Image processing issues: Install the SDK with `pip install lmstudio`

## Advanced Features

### SDK vs API Mode
- **SDK Mode**: Direct integration, supports images, better performance
- **API Mode**: REST-based fallback, text-only, works without SDK

### Debug Output
Enable debug mode to see:
- Model loading times
- Image processing status
- Token generation statistics
- Detailed error messages

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- ComfyUI
- LM Studio (running locally)
- See `requirements.txt` for Python packages
